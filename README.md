Social media has penetrated deep into our lives. Status updates, posts, likes, comments has surrounded us. But beyond words these can mean a lot more. In the bigger cloud of all these jargons can also lie a darker sphere of cyber bullying, which can lead to the bigger mental issues at hand.

"Health is wealth"
This has been a phrase which has been fed to us since our childhood. But a very important nuance of it is most negled- mental health.

Our idea stems on two essential areas - health and social media.

Thus, our platform is an amalgamation of both of them, trying to provide an early warning system for these signs of different mental states like whether he/she is depressed, having suicidal tendency etc or case of cyber bullying using the analysis of social media posts.

As a measure of safety on identification of any such instances there is an notfication sent to the the benificary added of choice.
Notifications send to the benificary only regarding to depression and Cyber bullying type posts because of User's privacy.

This can be used as a tool of parental monitoring with parents getting notification of any suspicious post on the child's timeline.
